Help me refactor this React component/Page by isolating into smaller, reusable components. Follow these principles:

Do not change any designing or content I only need to isolate into smaller components 

Component Isolation: Identify logical groupings of UI elements and functionality that can be separated into independent components.

Reusability: Ensure that each component is self-contained, has clear input (props), and minimal side effects.

Separation of Concerns: Extract presentation (UI elements) and logic (state management, event handling) into separate layers where appropriate.

TypeScript Best Practices: Use strict typing for props, state, and event handlers.

Leverage React.FC or React.Component for typing functional or class components, as needed.
Use interface or type for defining props and state types.

Folder Structure: Follow a scalable folder structure, e.g., components, pages, and hooks.

Performance: Optimize re-renders by memoizing components where necessary
