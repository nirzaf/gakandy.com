Help me refactor this React component/Page by isolating into smaller, reusable components. Follow these principles:

Component Isolation: Identify logical groupings of UI elements and functionality that can be separated into independent components.
Reusability: Ensure that each component is self-contained, has clear input (props), and minimal side effects.
Separation of Concerns: Extract presentation (UI elements) and logic (state management, event handling) into separate layers where appropriate.
TypeScript Best Practices:
Use strict typing for props, state, and event handlers.
Leverage React.FC or React.Component for typing functional or class components, as needed.
Use interface or type for defining props and state types.
Folder Structure: Follow a scalable folder structure, e.g., components, pages, and hooks.
Testing: Generate isolated unit tests for each component using testing libraries like Jest or React Testing Library.
Performance: Optimize re-renders by memoizing components where necessary using React.memo or useMemo.
Please provide a detailed refactor plan, suggesting how to split the components, and highlight any additional improvements adhering to TypeScript and React best practices
