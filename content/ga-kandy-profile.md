### 1. ASSURANCE SERVICES

Confidence of the business community is driven by the credibility place on the information reported by an entity, whether the information is financial or not.

For example, the level of the audit quality is very vital for maintaining the trust in the financial reporting process and integrity of financial information reported-the financial statements.

Our portfolio of assurance services includes;

#### External Audits

 Internal Audits

 Performance Audits

 Operational Audits

 Special Purpose Audits

Our assurance engagements are planned, performed, and supervised by technically competent and experienced professionals who ensures a solid foundation for a trust-worthy assurance report.

We identify following distinct phases in every assurance engagement:

1. Planning and Strategy

2. Execution

3. Conclusion and Reporting

#### External Audit

We, Global Associates Chartered Accountants are continuously researching on new audit techniques and tools being developed in the global context and, therefore, our approach is always par with them, but at a greater convenience and flexibility. Risk based audit approach gives us opportunities to perform an effective audit while sharing with our clients the benefits of efficiencies of the approach. Effectively performed audit makes shareholders feel confident that the financial statements are free of material misstatements and, therefore, the true business position which is of interest to the wide range of stakeholders (Regulators, Banks, Investors, Employees, etc.) is reflected in financial statements.


![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/568625e3708ba11c.jpg)

Other side of the coin is that all outside stakeholders feel confident in the true picture of the business by merely going through the financial statements. So, the bankers and 

Investors who are providing funds for business expansion or for new technology, suppliers who provide credits and customers who want to have long-term relationship can readily rely on the financial statements without spending time and money on evaluating the clients financial standing, creditworthiness, going concern, etc.

As our audits are performed in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, acquisition, training and retention of employees are dealt within the framework of professional standards and code of ethics, and the tone at the top is always for a high quality audit output, we now experience the luxury of an ever-expanding audit clientele.

#### Internal Audit

Aim of an internal audit is to protect and enhance the value of an organization through an objective evaluation of an entity’s risk management process, controls and governance aspects.

Internal audit function within an entity is frequently become less effective if it is prone to internal biases which will always be the result of management’s override of controls and inadequate competency and effort of the owner-managers. For an effective internal audit, certain core principles required to be present and operating effectively which could be hardly maintained in an internal audit function due to various pressures coming from co-employees, management, and sometimes from external parties like major suppliers.

As our internal audit is always governed by so called core principles i.e. integrity, professional competence and due care, objectivity and independence, appropriate communication, consideration of organizational strategies, objectives and risk aspects, adequate and timely deployment of resources, being insightful, proactive and future oriented, our present clientele is delighted to have us as the preferred internal audit partner in their organizational progress.


![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/8daaa8fe069142ef.jpg)

#### Performance Audit

Like every human being, every organization faces resources limitations which is capable of even making your grand friend an arch enemy if not managed well.

Resources are, therefore, required to be deployed economically, efficiently and effectively in the pursuit of achieving organizational objectives.

Allowing our clients the freedom of running their business, we perform an independent examination of programs, functions, operations or the management systems and procedures of our clients to assess whether they have achieved the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness as it was initially targeted in deploying the available resources.

#### Operational Audit

Any organization’s success depends on the performance of each operational unit.

For example, the cost of lost opportunities at one operational area may outweigh the noteworthy success in the utilization of opportunities by other operational units/functions. To make all operations accountable for its success, organizations need an objective evaluation by an independent party.

We perform this systematic review of effectiveness, efficiency and economy of operations while keeping in mind the core principles explained in Internal Audit.

Our approach, however, is flexible to accommodate managements’ diverse requirements and financial as well as non-financial information will be considered based on the relative importance.

#### Special Purpose Audits

Yet again, most of the businesses are exposed to various type of external and internal reporting requirements other than historical financial statements. This includes reports to regulators, reports for foreign investors, reports to be eligible for tax concessions, as an eligibility criterion for industrial awards, reports required under mergers and acquisition arrangements, etc.We perform these various reporting assignments within the framework of

International Standards on Assurance Engagements which require us to maintain the same professional standards as is required for External Audits.

### 2. Internal Audit

We offer internal audit to clients under two models, namely, fully outsourced model or co-sourced model. Those performing in-house controls assurance activity, be they internal audit or a management control function, are often struggling in the process of possessing all the technical and business expertise needed to effectively design or review business controls. This difficulty together with the pace of development and complexity in areas like technology and compliance make it very unlikely that an in-house team with finite resources will have the skills they need to generate adequate assurance in every case. We offer a pool of specialist technical resources from which a business can draw to meet their needs. As this support is only required when it is necessary, it gives an entity a cost-effective way of filling internal skills gaps.

Our service models are such that we are also willing to pass our knowledge and expertise to entity personnel during our assignments with the client.

This advantage is rarely obtainable and will enable an entity to reduce the dependency on external experts in the future.

### We offer our clients the following internal audit services:

Internal audit on an outsourced or co-sourced partnership basis has the following features:

### i. Outsourced:

Technical support

Input into risk framework register

Build the audit plan

Perform all aspects of testing including continuous monitoring reporting and follow up of  actions Plans

 Attend to audit committee meetings

 Liaise with external auditors and other third parties

### ii. Co-sourced:

Supply highly skilled staff to supplement the client’s existing audit team as business needs arise.Typically, this falls into three (3) areas.

a. when client has an expertise gap,

b. when client has a shortfall in human resources or other physical resources, or

c. when client sees the review as internally sensitive and prefers to use wholly independent resources.


![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/493c396099981866.jpg)

### Features common to both approaches include:

Client has access to specific industry knowledge or the technical skill set of on of our subject matter experts.

Both require regular update meetings with the management of the client

 Coaching and mentoring of staff happens while performing the assignment

 Efficiency of Computer-assisted audit techniques

 Efficiency of using standard audit programs, yet tailor made for the assignment.

### 3. Information Security & Data Protection

Our technology solutions are based on two principles:

a. the need for a greater amount of technical skills to address technical threats.

b. awareness that many of the greatest losses come from “routine” risks which are not effectively addressed.

Technology can be transformational in helping to deliver significant business improvements and yet it brings with it some of the greatest and fastest changing threats. With technology taking an increasing proportion of corporate spending, it now represents the major concentration of risk and reward for many businesses.

We have extensive experience of dealing with global regulators and providing data privacy solutions which ensure that compliant handling of client data does not disrupt “business as usual”.

### 3. Due Diligene

When buying anything, the legal maxim caveat emptor – ‘let the buyer beware’ – applies. That’s where due diligence comes in, and where we can help.

There are three types of due diligence: commercial, financial, and legal.

### Commercial due diligence

This is the process by which you, the buyer, assess the viability of your target purchase and its market position relative to your own. It is designed to ensure that you are buying a company with real value, which will complement and enhance your own business’s growth prospects.To help you do this, we will work closely with your key managers – those responsible for the integration and/or long-term running of your acquisition.

This is where our years of related industry knowledge provide genuine added value. When you are looking for pitfalls, it helps to know what to look for – what we certainly do.

Our knowledge of different industries and unique benchmarking capabilities can help you identify the areas that require the most scrutiny.

We thoroughly evaluate the target company’s financials before issuing our reports on its current and historical financial positions. We also review future prospects and reliability of financial forecasts.

With our expertise, we can advise you on whether the proposed purchase price is too high and, if required, help restructure a deal that suits you better is committed and competent to ensure the highest returns for our clients.

### Legal due diligence

Legal due diligence ensures that the price you pay is ‘fair’ and takes into account any liabilities and potential hidden downsides that might arise after the sale.

In this respect, we support our clients and work alongside the lawyers, not only to structure warranties, but also to help with tax and other potential areas of risk.

Warranties made by the vendor are a key part of any sale agreement. They cover both commercial and tax areas. They alert you to potential risks and allow us to help you manage those risks. Warranties need to be structured and worded carefully to enable you to claim compensation for any loss.

### 4. Joint Ventures & Shareholders Agreements

It is important to define a future business relationship from the outset. Whether the relationship comprises two parties getting together in a joint venture function, or a small number of shareholders getting together to form a new company and a new business, both involve a similar level of considerations.

We regularly help in the formation of new ventures and have detailed knowledge of the issues and how best to avoid the pitfalls that would come across in the future through possible inadvertences
